1. Installing and Running Webpack and Webpack-CLI
  - npm init -y
  - npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
{
  "name": "23-2-webpack-fcc",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
  + "start": "webpack",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "Temesghen Tekeste",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "webpack": "^5.13.0",

}

Note: By default npm start looks for a file index.js inside the src folder to run otherwise it will cause an error.

2. Imports and Exports and Moduels

Webpack now bundling all our app code

- We use import/export to indicate dependencies
- Webpack makes sure everything loads in the correct order
- We can remove all our additional script tags in index.html
